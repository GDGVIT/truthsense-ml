    "comment": "The speaker's delivery was generally smooth, but there were moments where the pace felt slightly rushed, and filler words were used. The speech had a good flow overall, with no long pauses, indicating a decent level of comfort with the material. However, there's room for improvement in terms of pacing and reducing filler words for a more confident delivery.",
