This folder contains the final versions of all the different components of Truthsense

- `audio.ipynb` is a clean version of `voice analysis/complete audio analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook with all the necessary information to test the feedback given by our pipeline on any `.wav` file.
- `posture.py` is a copy of `video/posture complete.py`.
- `fluency.py` is the training script for the LightGBM that we found worked best on our real world samples, on the dataset mentioned in [the data section in `fluency`](../fluency/README.md#data).
